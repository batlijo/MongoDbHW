I created an app that accomplishes the following:

Whenever a user visits my site, the app scrapes stories from a news outlet of my choice and displays them for the user. Each scraped article is saved to my application database. The app scrapes and displays the following information for each article:

Headline - the title of the article

Summary - a short summary of the article

URL - the url to the original article

Photos- images from the original article

Users are also able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments are saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users are also be able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments are visible to every user.

[ be creative and have fun with this!]
